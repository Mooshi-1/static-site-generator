important stuff

in bash, use 
chmod +x file.sh 

to add permissions to execute the file.

run directly using 

./file.sh

testing within file is useful at first but then take it to a separate test file so
that the user doesn't have to confirm the output. the test file will say whether it
passes or fails based on the (input, expected output) that the author creates. 


The 2>&1 is a shell redirection operator that redirects the standard error (2) to the same place as standard output (1). In other words:

    2 represents stderr (error messages)
    1 represents stdout (normal output)
    >& means "redirect to"
    2>&1 means "send error messages to the same place as normal output"

This is useful because:

    It captures both normal output AND error messages
    It ensures we can see any error messages that might help debug failing tests
    It prevents error messages from being lost or displayed separately
