important stuff

in bash, use 
chmod +x file.sh 

to add permissions to execute the file.

run directly using 

./file.sh

testing within file is useful at first but then take it to a separate test file so
that the user doesn't have to confirm the output. the test file will say whether it
passes or fails based on the (input, expected output) that the author creates.
